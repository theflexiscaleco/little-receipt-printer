A simple sinatra application to print out shopify orders as they are received.

Best hosted on heroku.
To deploy: checkout code locally, and install heroku toolkit.
From the root directory:

Then add your heroku url, with the path of /print_receipt to your shopify webhooks to send json on order payment.
